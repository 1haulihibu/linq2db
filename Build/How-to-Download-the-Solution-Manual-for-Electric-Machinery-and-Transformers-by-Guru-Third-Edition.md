One of the ways to optimize your article for SEO is to use relevant keywords that match the search intent of your target audience. Keywords are the words and phrases that users type into search engines to find what they are looking for. By using keywords that are related to your topic and that have high search volume and low competition, you can increase the chances of your article ranking higher on the search results pages.
  
To find the best keywords for your article, you can use tools such as Google Keyword Planner, Moz Keyword Explorer, or SEMrush Keyword Magic Tool. These tools can help you generate keyword ideas, analyze their metrics, and compare them with your competitors. You can also use tools such as Google Trends or AnswerThePublic to find out what people are searching for in your niche and what questions they have.
  
Once you have a list of keywords, you need to use them strategically in your article. You should include your main keyword in your title, headings, introduction, conclusion, and URL. You should also use variations and synonyms of your main keyword throughout your article to avoid keyword stuffing and to cover different aspects of your topic. However, you should not overuse keywords or force them into your sentences. You should always write naturally and for your readers, not for search engines.
